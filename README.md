Pywriter is a Python module for printing text to your console or terminal in the classic _typewriter effect_.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install pywriter.

```bash
pip install pywriter
```

## Usage

```python
import pywriter as pw


# returns 'Hello World!' character by character at the rate of one character per second
pw.write('Hello World!', rate=1)

# Let's introduce my latest features
pw.reverse('Hello World!', rate=1)
pw.typewriter('Hello World!', new="Jesse", idx=6, rate=1)



# You can decide to exclude the rate argument.
# That will print out your text at the default rate of 0.01

```

## Alternate Usage

```python
from pywriter import write, reverse, typewriter


# returns 'Hello World!' character by character at the rate of one character per second
write('Hello World!', rate=1)

# Let's introduce my latest features
reverse('Hello World!', rate=1)
typewriter('Hello World!', new="Jesse", idx=6, rate=1)


# However, it is recommended that you use pywriter.write
#instead of using the write function directly.
# Since this will help prevent any conflict in case there
#is another python module which also has a write function.

```
